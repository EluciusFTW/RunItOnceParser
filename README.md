# RunItOnceParser
RunItOnceParser is a CLI tool to analyze hand histories from [Run It Once Poker ](https://www.runitonce.eu/).

## Usage
Execute "Rioparser.exe /h" to see all available options.

## Status
The tool is still in very early stages. Particularily, the most obvious shortcomings are:
* Only recognizes PLO hands (I have no NLH hand histories, and since I'm based in Germany I can't play at the moment)
* Split pots and other "edge cases" are not handled yet
* Still not covered with tests
